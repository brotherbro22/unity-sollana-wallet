The Unity-Solana Wallet is an essential bridge connecting game developers and the Solana blockchain. With Solanaâ€™s quick and low-cost transactions, games can start using blockchain technology like never before - in real-time. Thousands of developers will bring millions of players into the Solana ecosystem. This will, in turn, make the Solana projects benefit from an increased number of participants, and cross-protocol interoperability in games will take us beyond the current understanding of DeFi.

Unity-Solana Wallet uses Solnet's implementation .NET SDK, but we had to modify the library to make it Unity compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 4.x. Solnet is Solana's .NET SDK to integrate with the .NET ecosystem. Solnet.

Import WalletController prefab into your scene.
Set Client Source (Mainnet/Testnet/Devnet/Custom uri) and Storage Method (Json/Simple txt) on SimpleWallet script in WalletController prefab.
If you use custom URI be careful to use WS/WSS instead of HTTP/HTTPS because WebSocket does not work with HTTP / HTTPS.
To save mnemonics in JSON format, select the JSON storage method, and if you want to save it as a regular string, select Simple Txt.
If you want to use mnemonics saved in JSON format, you must deserialize it first. You have an example in ReGenerateAccountScreen.cs in the ResolveMnemonicsByType method.
Create new Canvas
Import WalletHolder prefab into the Canvas or if you want your design just import wallet prefab and customize the scene like we did with WalletHolder.
